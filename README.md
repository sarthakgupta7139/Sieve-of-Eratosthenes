# Sieve-of-Eratosthenes
Python Program for Sieve of Eratosthenes
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is a method for finding all primes up to (and possibly including) a given natural. This method works well when is relatively small, allowing us to determine whether any natural number less than or equal to is prime or composite.

Given a number n, print all primes smaller than or equal to n. It is also given that n is a small number. 
For example, if n is 10, the output should be “2, 3, 5, 7”. If n is 20, the output should be “2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19”.
